## Semantic Versioning

The general format is ***MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH***, e.g `1.2.0`

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
